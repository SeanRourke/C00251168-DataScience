# Flower Classification Convolutional Neural Network Project

## Dataset

Dataset containing 4,242 images of flowers. Dataset obtained from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition. 

Dataset contained following (class / number of images):

- daisy / 764
- dandelion / 1,052
- rose / 784
- sunflower / 733
- tulip / 984

## Preprocessing

All images are resized to 244 x 244 in this notebook.

##  Tools and Tech Used

This project is written in Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Findings

From performing operations on this dataset, I have found that this convolutional neural network created to classify the flowers was not accurate. As seen by the accuracy score of around 0.60, the model is correct in its classification more often than not, but is not consistent enough to be relied upon.
